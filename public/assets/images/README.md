## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Format**: Use WebP for better compression, with PNG/JPG fallbacks
2. **Size**: Optimize images to reduce file size without losing quality
3. **Dimensions**: Resize to recommended dimensions before upload
4. **Compression**: Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
5. **Alt Text**: All images already have descriptive alt text in HTML

## How to Export from Current React App

If you need to extract images from the React app:

1. The images are stored in the build with `figma:asset` references
2. You'll need to export them from the original Figma source
3. Or use the browser's DevTools to download the loaded images
4. Save with the filenames listed above

## Fallback Images

If company images are not available, you can use:
- Stock photos from Unsplash (ensure proper licensing)
- Placeholder images temporarily
